# Microsoft Teams user activity report

The Teams user activity report gives insight into the types of activities that users in your organization perform in Teams. For example, one can see how many users communicate on an ad hoc basis through unscheduled meetings commonly referred to as 1:1 and group calls, meetings a Teams user has organized, and meetings a Teams user participated in. We share details about screen, video, and audio minutes, and chat communication statistics, such as how many users reply to and post channel messages, and how many users engage in 1:1 or group chat messages.

## View the user activity report

You must be a Teams service admin to make these changes. See [Use Teams administrator roles to manage Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/using-admin-roles) to read about getting admin roles and permissions.

1. In the left navigation of the Microsoft Teams admin center, click **Analytics & reports** > **Usage reports**. On the **View reports** tab, under **Report**, select **Teams user activity**.
2. Under **Date range**, select a range, and then click **Run report**.
